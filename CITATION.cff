abstract: >
  A strict, clarification-first system prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs)
  to convert structural geology planar measurements between Quadrant, Azimuth,
  Right-Hand Rule (RHR), and Dip/Dipdir notations. The prompt enforces geometric
  consistency, avoids silent assumptions, and returns results in tabular form
  for reproducible scientific workflows.
